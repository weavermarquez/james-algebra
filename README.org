** goal
valerie is designing a tech implementation of **james algebra**, which has multiple visual dialects (1d parens → 2d boxes/maps → 2d-3d paths/rooms → 3d blocks). entity counts are small (tens–hundreds), so performance is irrelevant; clarity, geometry, and morph animation matter most.

** key conclusions

**rendering**
- pick **one svg-based renderer**: either `react+svg` or `two.js (svg mode)`.
- skip pixi/konva/p5 unless doing future experiential/3d stuff.
  
**geometry kernels**

- **flatten-js**: handle polygons, boxes, networks, merges/splits. pairs neatly with d3/svg.
- **bezier-js**: handle curved “path” dialect; proper bezier math + handles.
- optional: **clipper2-wasm** if you later need robust polygon offsets.
  
**what to avoid**
- d3, pixi, konva, p5 all lack solid boolean geometry; fine for drawing only.
- paper.js too heavyweight unless you want full editor scaffolding.
  
**morph animation strategy**

1. normalize path orientation/winding.
2. resample both shapes to N evenly spaced points (arc-length).
3. align start points to minimize total distance.
4. interpolate points (lerp) → rebuild svg path each frame.
5. for split/merge, manage ghost points / progressive re-sampling.

**architecture**

- **core algebra** (rewrite logic) → **geometry kernel** (flatten/bezier) → **renderer adapter** (svg).
- one morph/tween module reused across dialects.
- kernels hidden behind small interface: `union`, `subtract`, `sample`, `closestPoint`, `tween`.

** tl;dr

→ keep a single svg renderer
→ use **flatten-js** for straight geometry
→ use **bezier-js** for curved dialects
→ animate via resampling and point interpolation
→ reserve konva/pixi/godot for later experiential modes

*** Core Concepts
A form of "iconic" arithmetic, this is mathematics that looks like what it means. There are only shapes, no operators nor operands.

Concepts

void

- Void has no properties. (Nothing is not something.)
- Form is either not nothing or an illusion.
- Void-equivalent iorms may vary in structure but not in relevance.
- Void-equivalent forms are syntactically inert and semantically irrelevant.

Containers
- Containers represent distinctions.
- Everything is a container.
- There is only one relation, contains.
- Empty containers are units.
- Containers are both object and process.

Structure

- Forms are patterns of containment.
- Valid forms can be constructed physically.
- Forms can be represented in many multi-dimensional notations. Containers do not support sequence.
- Containers are not limited to a specific capacity (no anty).
- The contents of any container are mutually independent.

Axioms

- Axioms subdivide existent forms into discrete groups.
- Axioms do not make existent forms void-equivalent, and vice versa. All canonical forms are unequal.

Equality

- Containers with equal contents are equal.
- Equals can be substituted for equals.
- Removing identical outer boundaries maintains equality.
- Removing equal contents maintains equality.
- Equality is quantized dynamically by transformation steps.
- Forms change meaning only when they cross a boundary.

Arithmetic

- To count is to identify, categorize, indicate, fuse, and label.
- Addition is putting forms into the same container.
- Multiplication is putting square forms into a round container. Exponential and logarithmic bases are defined by the interpretation. Inverses are represented by the same boundary in different contexts.

*** Thoughts on computational implementation
The network dialect described below - a D.A.G. with shared structure - is certainly the most tractable. Distinction Networks are closely related as they are for a simpler formal system, but I am including it because it will be useful for you.
**** Network Dialect
#+begin_quote
Network Dialect
The network dialect (Figure 13-6) is certainly the
most computationally tractable. It provides the image
oi nodes/locations/processors with links/paths/wires
between them. Each link is a contains relation, so that
the relational structure is explicit. Networks and other
relational dialects have an additional display requirement
to specify the direction of nesting, from shallowest to
deepest. The network version often presumes a gravi¬
tational metaphor, with deeper nesting shown at lower
levels. For a network the level of nesting is defined by
counting the nodes lying between beginning and goal
(input and output).
Networks are a well-established modeling tool in compu¬
tation and in mathematics. The structure of the generic
frame is clearly visible in a network as a link between
an upper round node and a lower square node. Multiple
contents are multiple lower links. Deletion of structure
is just disconnecting a link. Even the inverter diamond
fits naturally into the patterns of flow. Networks support
any number of types of container.
Unlike the enclosure dialects, networks do not require
multiple replicas of variables. We can use a single node
for each variable, and access the variable through mul¬
tiple links, or pointers. The forms of Arrangement and
Replication in Figure 13-6 show this feature clearly. The
experience of driving on roads between different cities
provides familiarity to the network approach of no rep¬
licated objects.
The fluidity of object and reference in networks can be
expressed as a transformation rule that is unique to this
(and similar) dialects, structure sharing. In structure
sharing, nodes in a network that share the same linking
structure can be joined into a single node with multiple
links. Entire subnetworks are replaced by links to shared

structure. Structure sharing is not available in textual
dialects. The textual representation ot each of the above
forms is ([A])([A]). Multiple occurrence of the same
variable in a textual dialect emulates shared structure
in a network dialect. The absence of structure sharing
in symbolic mathematics has lead to rampant replication
of symbols and a presumption that replication is free. As
noted in Chapter 9, replication is the source of complexity.
Not only is notation not independent of meaning, it can
also actively determine meaning. There is little structure
sharing in the physical world since all physical objects are
unique.8 If two sheets of paper have the same sentence
written on them, then the two virtual sentences share the
same structure. However, the two physical sheets of paper
do not share the same structure (i.e. they are not replicas)
although they may share abstract properties such as use,
color, shape, even content. Representational systems that
lack structure sharing risk confusing features of the sym¬
bol ic model with features of the physical circumstance
being modeled.

** Overall System Concept
We are building an interactive tutor, scratch pad, and calculator for James Algebra.
James Algebra is a pattern-based formal system with rich variety for visual dialects, from 1d parens, 2d boxes/maps, 2d/experiential paths/rooms, and 3d rooms.

Key features
- Interactive and animated sandbox system playing with James Algebra in multiple dialects
- Has features similar to existing programming language sandboxes / interactive playgrounds:
  - Gallery of examples to play around with
  - Saving and loading programs
- Challenges to manipulate forms together to practice calculation
- James Algebra <> Conventional Algebra translator

#+begin_quote
A dominant characteristic ot boundary forms is the
point-of-view of the reader/participant. Forms can be
read from the outside, objectively, or from the inside, sub¬
jectively. Subjective reading includes participation within
the form itself. Linear form, in contrast, lacks an inside,
forcing the perspective that the reader is outside, in some
higher dimension. In its desire to remove human bias,
mathematics has embraced the outside, objective view¬
point, creating a notation that lacks both participation
and dynamics. Process must then be exhibited as steps.
A refinement that appears to have been overlooked is
that objectivity, seeing things as objects, viewing reality
from the outside, does not achieve neutrality. Objectivity
limits our perspective so severely that we bel leve we are
not only super-human but that we have access to locations
outside of our universe!
Objectivity makes us the outermost boundary.

** 1. Core User Flows
A user lands on the index page, which is a simple landing page and a link to the sandbox.
When they click on the sandbox, are greeted with the empty sandbox page with a simple James Form.

** 3. Architecture Diagram

*** Webserver Architecture
Client :: The key feature right now. Primary feature is a specific page to serve a live sandbox with sidebar for meta-information. React Router and embeds Sandbox.
Server :: Minimal for now; only serves routes. React Router Framework.
Database :: May hold a catalogue of examples, showcases. Likely Supabase.

*** Client
**** React Router
I'm just familiar with it, is all.

**** Sandbox Sidebar
- Dialect switching
- James Algebra <> Conventional Algebra translation
- History
**** Sandbox 
The interaction model for each component is primarily mouse-based.
For now, let's do a workflow of "select action from rules -> highlight possible application locations -> click to specify location" for users to act with the limited set of axioms / theorems to transform the displayed James Form.

- Logic Engine :: James Algebra rule system, state management (undo/redo).
  - =tau-prolog= 
- Geometry Kernel :: Handles geometry and animation logic
  - =flatten-js= 
    - point, vector, line, ray, segment, circle, arc, polygon.
    - Handles spatial queries through Planar Set.
    - find intersections, check inclusion, calculate distance, apply affine transformation, perform boolean operation.
    - All classes export to SVG.
- Renderer :: Renders to screen
  - =d3js= explicitly supported by =flatten-js=, other graphic libraries would require additional work to bridge
